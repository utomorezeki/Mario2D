Our team discussed that the burndown chart for this sprint was just okay. None of us started or work until the Sunday before so no progress was made until later on. Also, everything was finished for good the day of. Not everyone remembers to move there tasks and change the work amount so that is why there are large increases in work being started and finished. We need to do more work in the beginning to even our work load and show more improvement in our burndown chart. 

Our team believes that things went well during this sprint. Being able to work on our own elements allowed less issues to occur when trying to finish on time. We did communicate when our feature was done or things were being pushed. We also had time to fix some of the leftover issues from Sprint 5 which cleaned the game up more. Overall we could still improve on starting work earlier and consitently working on things.
