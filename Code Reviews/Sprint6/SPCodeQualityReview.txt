Specific comments on code quality: 

The constructor only takes 3 arguments which is an improvement from the 5-6 arguments used for
constructors of item classes in the previous sprints. As a result, this class has somewhat 
(because this class is still dependent on the game class) loose coupling.
The class methods are not too long and only deal with what they are supposed to do so the class
also has high cohesion.
