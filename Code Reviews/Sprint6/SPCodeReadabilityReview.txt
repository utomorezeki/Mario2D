Specific comments on readability: 

The names of the various functions and class members of the LargeSpinFireBeam class are
self-explanatory. The class has Update(), Draw(), DestinationRectangle(), LoadArray() and
ChangeMarioState() methods. 

Additionally, even though the fire beam is a new enemy type, it implements the IItem interface 
and is included as a item class which is really confusing since items don't harm Mario.
